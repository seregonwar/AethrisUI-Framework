# AethrisUI Framework | PyReact

## Overview

**AethrisUI** is an innovative and highly customizable framework developed by **SeregonWar** for advanced graphical user interface (UI) modeling. Designed to offer modern and flexible functionality, the framework draws inspiration from popular UI development environments for web and mobile, such as ReactJS and VueJS, combining the power of a modular architecture with proprietary syntax that simplifies interaction with graphical components.

AethrisUI is ideal for developers looking to create dynamic, responsive interfaces while leveraging advanced customization tools. The framework’s flexibility enables seamless integration with emerging web technologies, paving the way for new possibilities in web app development.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Framework Support**: AethrisUI is compatible with popular web frameworks and languages, such as ReactJS and VueJS, ensuring easy integration with existing web projects.
- **Advanced Customization**: Enables defining and customizing components and graphical interfaces with a dedicated syntax, giving developers complete control over the UI.
- **Real-Time Graphical Modeling**: With an upcoming development environment (similar to QtCreator for C++), users will be able to design and edit interfaces in real-time, optimizing workflow.
- **Integrated IDE Support**: AethrisUI will include a dedicated IDE, specifically designed to simplify interface management and customization without the need for frequent recompilations.

## Syntax and Architecture

AethrisUI introduces a **proprietary syntax** designed to make the development experience straightforward and intuitive. Inspired by major UI frameworks, this unique syntax allows for:
- Creating responsive components.
- Defining customized, adaptive behaviors.
- Keeping UI code organized and easily readable.

Its modular structure enables adding or removing components without deep changes to the project, supporting more agile and scalable UI management.
